> Yeoman generator for creating CELA stack applications, using CouchDB, Express, Lockit and AngularJS - lets you quickly set up a project following best practices.

## Usage

Install `generator-cela`:
```
npm install -g generator-cela
```

Make a new directory, and `cd` into it:
```
mkdir my-new-project && cd $_
```

Run `yo cela`, optionally passing an app name:
```
yo cela [app-name]
```

Run `grunt` for building, `grunt serve` for preview, and `grunt serve:dist` for a preview of the built app.

## Prerequisites

* CouchDB - Download and Install [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org) - If you plan on scaffolding your project, you'll need CouchDB to be installed and have the `couchdb` process running.

## Supported Configurations

**Client**

* Scripts: `JavaScript`, `CoffeeScript`, `Babel`
* Markup:  `HTML`, `Jade`
* Stylesheets: `CSS`, `Sass`,
* Angular Routers: `ngRoute`, `ui-router`

**Server**

* Database: `None`, `CouchDB`
* Authentication boilerplate: `Yes`, `No`, `Lockit`
* oAuth integrations: `Facebook` `Twitter` `Google`
* Socket.io integration: `Yes`, `No`

## Injection

A grunt task looks for new files in your `client/app` and `client/components` folder and automatically injects them in the appropriate places based on an injection block.

* `scss` files into `client/app.scss`
* `css` files into `client/index.html`
* `js` files into `client/index.html`
* `coffeescript` temp `js` files into `client/index.html`
* `babel` temp `js` files into `client/index.html`

## Generators

Available generators:

* App
    - [cela](#app) (aka [cela:app](#app))
* Server Side
    - [cela:endpoint](#endpoint)
* Client Side
    - [cela:route](#route)
    - [cela:controller](#controller)
    - [cela:filter](#filter)
    - [cela:directive](#directive)

### App
Sets up a new AngularJS + Express app, generating all the boilerplate you need to get started.

Example:
```bash
yo cela
```

### Endpoint
Generates a new API endpoint.


Example:
```bash
yo cela:endpoint message
[?] What will the url of your endpoint be? /api/messages
```

Produces:

    server/api/message/index.js
    server/api/message/message.spec.js
    server/api/message/message.controller.js
    server/api/message/message.model.js  (optional)
    server/api/message/message.socket.js (optional)

### Route
Generates a new route.

Example:
```bash
yo cela:route myroute
[?] Where would you like to create this route? client/app/
[?] What will the url of your route be? /myroute
```

Produces:

    client/app/myroute/myroute.js
    client/app/myroute/myroute.controller.js
    client/app/myroute/myroute.controller.spec.js
    client/app/myroute/myroute.html
    client/app/myroute/myroute.scss


### Controller
Generates a controller.

Example:
```bash
yo cela:controller user
[?] Where would you like to create this controller? client/app/
```

Produces:

    client/app/user/user.controller.js
    client/app/user/user.controller.spec.js

### Directive
Generates a directive.

Example:
```bash
yo cela:directive myDirective
[?] Where would you like to create this directive? client/app/
[?] Does this directive need an external html file? Yes
```

Produces:

    client/app/myDirective/myDirective.directive.js
    client/app/myDirective/myDirective.directive.spec.js
    client/app/myDirective/myDirective.html
    client/app/myDirective/myDirective.scss

**Simple directive without an html file**

Example:
```bash
yo cela:directive simple
[?] Where would you like to create this directive? client/app/
[?] Does this directive need an external html file? No
```

Produces:

    client/app/simple/simple.directive.js
    client/app/simple/simple.directive.spec.js

### Filter
Generates a filter.

Example:
```bash
yo cela:filter myFilter
[?] Where would you like to create this filter? client/app/
```

Produces:

    client/app/myFilter/myFilter.filter.js
    client/app/myFilter/myFilter.filter.spec.js

### Service
Generates an AngularJS service.

Example:
```bash
yo cela:service myService
[?] Where would you like to create this service? client/app/
```

Produces:

    client/app/myService/myService.service.js
    client/app/myService/myService.service.spec.js


You can also do `yo cela:factory` and `yo cela:provider` for other types of services.

### Decorator
Generates an AngularJS service decorator.

Example:
```bash
yo cela:decorator serviceName
[?] Where would you like to create this decorator? client/app/
```

Produces

    client/app/serviceName/serviceName.decorator.js

###Openshift

Deploying to OpenShift can be done in just a few steps:

    yo cela:openshift

A live application URL will be available in the output.

> **oAuth**
>
> If you're using any oAuth strategies, you must set environment variables for your selected oAuth. For example, if we're using Facebook oAuth we would do this :
>
>     rhc set-env FACEBOOK_ID=id -a my-openshift-app
>     rhc set-env FACEBOOK_SECRET=secret -a my-openshift-app
>
> You will also need to set `DOMAIN` environment variable:
>
>     rhc set-env DOMAIN=<your-openshift-app-name>.rhcloud.com
>
>     # or (if you're using it):
>
>     rhc set-env DOMAIN=<your-custom-domain>
>
> After you've set the required environment variables, restart the server:
>
>     rhc app-restart -a my-openshift-app

To make your deployment process easier consider using [grunt-build-control](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/grunt-build-control).

**Pushing Updates**

    grunt

Commit and push the resulting build, located in your dist folder:

    grunt buildcontrol:openshift

### Heroku

Deploying to heroku only takes a few steps.

    yo cela:heroku

To work with your new heroku app using the command line, you will need to run any `heroku` commands from the `dist` folder.

Your app should now be live. To view it run `heroku open`.

>
> If you're using any oAuth strategies, you must set environment variables for your selected oAuth. For example, if we're using **Facebook** oAuth we would do this :
>
>     heroku config:set FACEBOOK_ID=id
>     heroku config:set FACEBOOK_SECRET=secret
>
> You will also need to set `DOMAIN` environment variable:
>
>     heroku config:set DOMAIN=<your-heroku-app-name>.herokuapp.com
>
>     # or (if you're using it):
>
>     heroku config:set DOMAIN=<your-custom-domain>
>

To make your deployment process easier consider using [grunt-build-control](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/grunt-build-control).

#### Pushing Updates

    grunt

Commit and push the resulting build, located in your dist folder:

    grunt buildcontrol:heroku


## Bower Components

The following packages are always installed by the [app](#app) generator:

* angular
* angular-cookies
* angular-mocks
* angular-resource
* angular-messages
* angular-animate
* angular-sanitize
* angular-scenario
* angular-aria
* es5-shim
* font-awesome
* json3
* jquery
* lodash

These packages are installed optionally depending on your configuration:

* angular-route
* angular-ui-router
* angular-socket-io
* angular-material

All of these can be updated with `bower update` as new versions are released.

## Configuration
Yeoman generated projects can be further tweaked according to your needs by modifying project files appropriately.

A `.yo-rc` file is generated for helping you copy configuration across projects, and to allow you to keep track of your settings. You can change this as you see fit.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the client and server unit tests with karma and mocha.

Use `grunt test:server` to only run server tests.

Use `grunt test:client` to only run client tests.

**Protractor tests**

To setup protractor e2e tests, you must first run

`npm run update-webdriver`

Use `grunt test:e2e` to have protractor go through tests located in the `e2e` folder.

## Environment Variables

Keeping your app secrets and other sensitive information in source control isn't a good idea. To have grunt launch your app with specific environment variables, add them to the git ignored environment config file: `server/config/local.env.js`.

<!-- ## Contribute

See the [contributing docs](https://github.com/italoag/generator-cela/blob/master/contributing.md)

This project has 2 main branches: `master` and `canary`. The `master` branch is where the current stable code lives and should be used for production setups. The `canary` branch is the main development branch, this is where PRs should be submitted to (backport fixes may be applied to `master`).

By seperating the current stable code from the cutting-edge development we hope to provide a stable and efficient workflow for users and developers alike.

When submitting an issue, please follow the [guidelines](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/blob/master/contributing.md#issue-submission). Especially important is to make sure Yeoman is up-to-date, and providing the command or commands that cause the issue.

When submitting a PR, make sure that the commit messages match the [AngularJS conventions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/).

When submitting a bugfix, try to write a test that exposes the bug and fails before applying your fix. Submit the test alongside the fix.

When submitting a new feature, add tests that cover the feature.

See the `travis.yml` for configuration required to run tests. -->
